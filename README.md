# Youtube-Downloader

It is a python app for downloading media from Youtube.<br><br>
Status: unfinished / debugging / improving functionalities<br><br>
Currently:<br><br>
1 - Fetch data from Youtube (thumbnails, video titles & view counts); the fetching should be done without needing a Youtube/Google account.<br>
2 - Analyze video titles, thumbnails, and video links data so it can be displayed.<br>
3 - Display a scrollable list with GUI showing: the Title (left-side) with a hyperlink to the video, the Thumbnail (right-side)<br>
4 - The GUI should have a filter form (above the list) with the options “alphabetically” “by views”.; the default is “by views”<br>
5 - The list should only display the first 100 videos (with the applied filter) per page.<br>
6 - The GUI should have a page selector at the bottom (after the 100th video displayed on the list); the default is page “1”.<br>
